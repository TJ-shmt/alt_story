    "title": "Prologue",
    "text": "Night City, a neon-drenched metropolis where the future and the forgotten collide. Skyscrapers, like digital monoliths, pierce the smog-laden sky, while the streets below teem with a cacophony of life and artificial existence. In this city of dreams and nightmares, the line between the real and the virtual blurs, and every soul is chasing their own version of salvation or damnation. <br> You, an adept wanderer of this concrete jungle, find yourself amidst the chaos, waiting. Your eyes are fixed on your personal communicator, anticipating a message from the Netrunner, a master of the digital underworld. But the screen remains ominously silent, a stark contrast to the relentless pulse of Night City."
